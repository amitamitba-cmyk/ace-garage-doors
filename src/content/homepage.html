<h3>Professional Garage Door Spring Replacement & Repair</h3>
<p>Garage door springs are under immense tension and are critical for safe operation. In Kansas City, the constant temperature swings can exacerbate spring fatigue. Our experts specialize in both torsion and extension spring replacement, using high-grade, oil-tempered springs designed for longevity. We ensure proper spring gauge sizing, such as a .225 wire diameter for standard 7ft high, 16ft wide residential doors, to perfectly balance your door. <strong>Warning: Never attempt to replace garage door springs yourself; the stored energy can cause severe injury or even death.</strong> Trust the certified professionals at Ace Garage Doors for safe and efficient spring service. <a href='tel:+18164414562'>Get a free spring replacement estimate!</a></p>

<h3>Garage Door Opener Installation & Service (LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Genie)</h3>
<p>Your garage door opener is the brain of your system. We install and repair all types of openers, including quiet belt-drive models (like the LiftMaster 8550W with battery backup, perfect for homes with bedrooms above the garage), durable chain-drive units, and space-saving wall-mount openers. We address common KC-specific issues like opener circuit board corrosion from humidity or power surge damage during severe thunderstorms. Our technicians are <strong>LiftMaster certified</strong> and proficient with Chamberlain, Genie, and other leading brands.

        <h3 class='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>How does Kansas City's weather affect my garage door?</h3>
        <p class='text-gray-700'>Kansas City's extreme humidity can corrode sensors, while severe freeze-thaw cycles misalign tracks. Our intense temperature swings cause metal expansion/contraction, throwing doors off balance. Ace Garage Doors specializes in weather-proofing and maintenance tailored to KC's climate, ensuring your door withstands these challenges.</p>

        <h3 class='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>Is it safe to repair my garage door springs myself?</h3>
        <p class='text-gray-700'>Absolutely not. Garage door springs are under extreme tension and can cause severe injury or even death if handled improperly. We strongly advise against DIY spring repair. Always contact a trained and certified professional like Ace Garage Doors for any spring-related issues to ensure your safety and the proper functioning of your door.</p>
