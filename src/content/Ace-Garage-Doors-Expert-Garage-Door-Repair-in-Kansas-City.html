        <h2>Common Garage Door Problems We Solve</h2>
        <p>Garage doors are complex mechanical systems that experience wear and tear over time. Recognizing common issues can help you address problems before they become major emergencies. Ace Garage Doors specializes in diagnosing and repairing all types of garage door malfunctions.</p>

        <h3>Torsion Spring Replacement & Extension Spring Repair</h3>
        <p>Garage door springs are crucial for the balanced operation of your door. A broken spring can prevent your door from opening or closing, and attempting to operate it with a broken spring can cause further damage. We offer expert <strong>torsion spring replacement</strong> and <strong>extension spring repair</strong> services. These springs are under immense tension, so it's vital to leave spring repairs to the professionals. We ensure the correct springs are installed and tensioned properly for safe operation.</p>

        <h3>Garage Door Cable Repair</h3>
        <p>Frayed or snapped garage door cables can also render your door inoperable and pose a safety hazard. Our technicians are adept at <strong>garage door cable repair</strong>, ensuring your cables are securely attached and properly tensioned. We can replace worn cables to restore the smooth functionality of your garage door.</p>

        <h3>Garage Door Panel Replacement</h3>
        <p>Accidents happen, and sometimes garage door panels can become dented, cracked, or otherwise damaged. Whether it's from a vehicle impact or storm damage, we can help. We offer efficient <strong>garage door panel replacement</strong> to restore the aesthetic appeal and structural integrity of your door. In many cases, we can match existing panels to ensure a seamless look.</p>

        <h3>Garage Door Roller Replacement & Track Alignment</h3>
        <p>Worn-out rollers can cause your garage door to become noisy, jerky, or difficult to move. Similarly, misaligned tracks can lead to rollers jumping off, causing significant operational issues. We provide professional <strong>garage door roller replacement</strong> and precise <strong>garage door track alignment</strong> to ensure your door glides smoothly along its path.</p>

        <h3>Garage Door Weatherstripping</h3>
        <p>Damaged or missing <strong>garage door weatherstripping</strong> can lead to drafts, water infiltration, and energy loss. We can replace worn-out seals around your garage door to create a tighter seal, protecting your home from the elements and improving energy efficiency.</p>
